### Q1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
The coding test, which involved developing a task management application, was completed within two days of the assignment of the test; more specifically, it took me 8 hours to complete the test (4 hours a day), which included the time utilized in designing, developing, and documenting the project.

### Q2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
I have completed the assigned coding test and created a basic `Task Management` application in `React.js`, which is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. One of the most useful features added to the language in recent ECMAScript versions is the "nullish coalescing operator" (`??`). The nullish coalescing (`??`) operator is a logical operator that returns value on the right-hand side of the operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined; otherwise, it returns its left-hand side operand.

An example of using the nullish coalescing operator used in the application:

```javascript
// Using nullish coalescing operator to create and initialize the Tasks array
useEffect(() => {
    const storedTasks = (JSON.parse(localStorage.tasks)) ?? []
    setInitialTasks(storedTasks);
    setTasks(storedTasks);
  }, []);
```

### Q3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Tracking down performance issues in a React application can involve various techniques. Some general steps include:

- **Profiling:** Utilizing React DevTools for profiling the application by identifying components with the most significant render times and optimizing them.

- **Memoization:** Ensureing that components and functions are appropriately memoized, preventing unnecessary renders.

I had to use the React DevTools to monitor the state of the variables in the components to debug the application.


### Q4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
If I had enough time to enhance the task management application, I would surely consider the following features to be added in the application:

- **User Authentication:** Implementation of user authentication system for personalized task lists and security.

- **Drag-and-Drop:** A drag-and-drop interface for rearranging tasks.

- **Notifications:** Integration of real-time notification system for task updates and reminders.

- **Dark Mode:** An extra feature to enhance user experience with the option to switch between light and dark modes.

- **Mobile Responsiveness:** I would have made sure that the application is fully responsive for various devices.
